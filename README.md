# Gender_Prediction_Using_Voice_with_LR_KNN_SVM

## Overview
This project implements voice recognition using machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression.
- **Voice Recognition Dataset**: Data preprocessing and feature extraction included.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare performance metrics across different models.

## Techniques Used
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A supervised learning algorithm used for classification by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric algorithm that classifies based on the nearest data points in the feature space.
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model that applies a logistic function to predict binary outcomes.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes normalization, encoding, and splitting the dataset for effective training and testing.
- **Feature Extraction**: Transform raw audio data into measurable features suitable for machine learning.

## Results
The notebook concludes with a comparison of the performance of the implemented models. The accuracy achieved by each model is as follows:
- **SVM**: 97.8% accuracy
- **KNN**: 97.1% accuracy
- **Logistic Regression**: 96.5% accuracy
